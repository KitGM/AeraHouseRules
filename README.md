## Character Creation

Character creation will generally follow the normal 5e rules, however will some exceptions:

<b>Background:</b>

If there is no background that fits your character a custom one can be made, but must be approved by me. A custom background would have the following features:

❶ *Two skill Proficiencies*   
❷ *One language*  
❸ *Background specific equipment*   
❹ *Background Feature*  

Generally the idea with making a custom background is that you follow the overarching theme that you intend to go with for it. For example, the Soldier background having
Athletics and Intimidation proficiencies makes sense for it. However exceptions can be made depending on circumstance.

If you want to modify an already existing background that can also be done, just be sure to check with me to make when you do so.

<b>Stat Rolls</b>

When rolling for stats, use the method: 4d6 drop lowest 1 for each stat. If the total is less than 70 you can reroll.

Roll20 Command: */roll [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]]*

<b>Starting at Higher Levels</b>

When you create a character that is above a certain level threshold you will get an increase in money and items accordingly. See the following table:

 Level  | Wealth | Magic Items
---|-----------|--------------
  1-4  | See Class | None 
  5-8  | 500gp + 1d10x25  | 1 common item 
  9-12  | 2,500gp + 1d10x125 | 2 common items, 1 uncommon item 
  13-16  | 5,000gp + 1d10x250  | 3 common items, 2 uncommon items 
  17-20  | 20,000gp + 1d20x1000 | 3 common items, 2 uncommon items, 1 rare item 

## Criticals
When you score a Critical on an attack roll, you can roll double the amount of dice that you would normally roll for that attack. Example: 2d6 becomes 4d6.
