## Allowed Content

All of the official WotC content will be allowed, but for playtest material and other sources I will judge on a case-by-case basis - which includes Unearthed Arcana since it is playtest material. Most of the content from Unearthed Arcana will likely be allowed, but if you want to use something from Unearthed Arcana, or any unoffical source,
check with me first just in case. That being said, here is a list of content that I for sure do not allow as of right now as well as a list of content that I do allow from unofficial sources:

<b>Banned Content</b>

*[Class] Mystic*

<b>Other Allowed Sources/Content</b>

## Character Creation

Character creation will generally follow the normal 5e rules, however with some exceptions:

<b>Background:</b>

If there is no background that fits your character a custom one can be made, but must be approved by me. A custom background would have the following features:

❶ *Two skill Proficiencies & One Tool Proficiency*   
❷ *One language*  
❸ *Background specific equipment*   
❹ *Background Feature*  

Generally the idea with making a custom background is that you follow the overarching theme that you intend to go with for it. For example, the Soldier background having
Athletics and Intimidation proficiencies makes sense for it. However exceptions can be made depending on circumstance.

If you want to modify an already existing background that can also be done, just be sure to check with me when you do so.

<b>Stat Rolls</b>

When rolling for stats, use the method: 4d6 keep highest 3 for each stat. If the total is less than 70 you can reroll.

Roll20 Command: */roll [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]] + [[4d6kh3]]*

<b>Starting at Higher Levels</b>

When you create a character that is above a certain level threshold you will get an increase in money and items accordingly. See the following table:

 Level  | Wealth | Magic Items
---|-----------|--------------
  1-4  | See Class | None 
  5-8  | 500gp + 1d10x25  | 1 common item 
  9-12  | 2,500gp + 1d10x125 | 2 common items, 1 uncommon item 
  13-16  | 5,000gp + 1d10x250  | 3 common items, 2 uncommon items 
  17-20  | 20,000gp + 1d20x1000 | 3 common items, 2 uncommon items, 1 rare item 
  
<b>Karma</b>:
You can take anti-feats that give a certain amount of karma points. These karma points can be spent to obtain feats. You can only take up to 3 points worth of karma. A full-feat
costs 2 karma, half-feats cost 1 karma.

## Criticals
When you score a Critical on an attack roll, you can roll double the amount of dice that you would normally roll for that attack. Example: 2d6 becomes 4d6. This is the base 5e ruling.

## Flanking

Flanking is used in this ruleset, however instead of advantage you gain a +2 to hit instead.

## Feat Changes

* <b>Weapon Master</b>: This feat now grants a Fighting Style from the Fighter class.

## Gameplay Changes

  * <b>New Action</b>: Sprint - Taking the Sprint action will allow you to move much greater distances in a short amount of time, however you forfeit safety when doing so. Upon taking the Sprint action you multiply your walking speed by four until the end of the current turn. Additionally, until the end of the current turn enemies have advantage on opportunity attacks against you, you have disadvantage on Perception checks, and if at any point you fall prone during your movement you lose the rest of your movement speed for the turn. Trying to change direction in any way while Sprinting will require an Acrobatics check to see if you remain on your feet. 

## Initiative

A creature's initiative bonus is their Dexterity modifier plus their Wisdom modifier.


## Spell Changes

* <b>Barkskin</b>: No longer requires concentration.
* <b>Goodberry</b>: Now has a duration of 1 minute. The effects of the spell are only applied after the duration has expired.
* <b>Mage Armor</b>: Calculation Changed to: 10 + Spellcasting Modifier + Dexterity Modifier
* <b>Mordenkainen's Sword</b>: Now has extra attacks based on the spell slot level used to cast it. Two attacks with a 7th level slot, three attacks with an 8th level slot, four attacks with a 9th level slot. You must now use an action to move the sword and attack instead of a bonus action. In addition, you can also make opportunity attacks with the sword when an enemy runs out of the swords range. The rules for opportunity attacks apply as normal - you must use your reaction and you only get one attack.
* <b>Stoneskin</b>: No longer requires concentration.

## Class Changes

* <b>Sorcerer</b>
    
    * Sorcerer's no longer prepare metamagic permanently. Instead they prepare metamagic at the end of a long rest.
    * Sorcerer subclasses gain Sorcerous Origin spells. [This document](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/HyBT1deBmN) details the spells each subclass gets.
    * Upon finishing a short rest you can regain a number of Sorcery Points equal to half your Sorcerer level (rounded up). Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

* <b>Monk</b>

    * Monk Level 20 Capstone: If you have less than 4 ki points you can use an action to regain ki points equal to your Wisdom modifier. Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest.
    * Martial Arts Enhancement:
      * Simple Weapons with the Thrown property count as Monk Weapons for you.
      * When you make an attack with a weapon that has the Thrown property, you can spend 1 ki point to double the short and long ranges of the attack.
    * Flurry of Blows Enhancement:
      * When you use Flurry of Blows, you can forego making unarmed strikes to instead make two thrown weapon attacks. You can draw these thrown weapons as part of the attacks. The thrown weapons must be Monk Weapons for you in order for this to apply.

## Subclass Changes

* <b>Arcane Archer</b>: Arcane Archer is now a Ranger subclass instead of a Fighter subclass.
